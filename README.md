# React-and-Next.js 🚀

This is a practice repo for React and Next.js. We're migrating to a new repo for Next.js' folder and file structure functionality. Stay tuned!!! 

## Why React and Next.js? 🤔

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites. This dynamic duo can make your web development faster and more efficient!

## What's Cooking? 🍳

I'm in the process of migrating the codebase to take advantage of Next.js' folder and file structure functionality. This will make the project more organized and maintainable. So, keep an eye on this space!

## Fun Fact 🎉

Did you know? Next.js was developed by Vercel, formerly known as Zeit. It's named "Next" because it's seen as the "next" thing in web development... pretty cool, right?

## Get Involved! 👥

Everybody love collaboration! Feel free to fork this repo, make changes, and submit a pull request. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or even updating this fun README, your contributions are welcome!

Remember, the journey of a developer begins with a single a single commit! ~Anonymous~ 😉 Happy coding!
